# KODIst: yet another [KODI](https://kodi.tv/) distribution
> Premiliary release, builds, but no runtime testing done.

## Overview
Implemented as KODI specific [PTXdist](https://www.ptxdist.org/)
layer above [DistroKit](https://git.pengutronix.de/cgit/DistroKit/)
although different base layers can be chosen easily. Whatever hardware
lower layers support is brought here and used, so focus is kept only
on KODI.

## Requirements
You need to have PTXdist and DistroKit installed... obviously.

## Build
Consult [PTXdist Userâ€™s Manual](https://www.ptxdist.org/doc/user_manual_section.html)
to get familiar with basic principles. Once these are understood and
[platform selected](https://www.ptxdist.org/doc/user_manual_section.html#selecting-a-hardware-platform)
building an image is as easy as typing
```sh
ptxdist images
```
